# Bio

I'm currently a Ph.D. student in the School of Computing at the National University of Singapore, under the supervision of [Prof. Mong Li Lee](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leeml/) and [Prof. Wynne Hsu](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~whsu/). 

My primary areas of interest in research are combating misinformation, multimedia content analysis (sentiment, trust), and multimodal reasoning. Recently, I focus more on advancing large vision-language foundation models for misinformation detection, location, and explanation generation.
