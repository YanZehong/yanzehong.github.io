Some suggestions to start learning to feed yourself and evaluate your solutions rather than just copy solutions out of textbooks. 

## 1. Function Style
Some personal tips about how to make a nice function:
- Name your function as if it's a command you are giving to the class and make the class 'do things'. Same as _pop_ is saying 'Hey list, pop this off.' It isn't called _remove\_from\_end\_of\_list_ because even though that's what it does. that's not a command to a list.  
- Keep your function small and simple.  

## 2. Class Style
- Use 'camel case' like MyClassName rather than my_class_name.  
- Try not to do too much in the \_\_init\_\_ functions. It makes them harder to use.  
- Be consistent in how you organize your funciton arguments.  
- Try not to use variables come from the module or globals. They should be fairly self-contained.  
- A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. Consistency is good, but foolish following some idiotic mantra. Think for yourself.  
- Always have _class Name(object)_ format or else you will get in big trouble.
