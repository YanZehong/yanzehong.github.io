A good starting point for many programming problems when you are using Python, specifically with object-oriented programming (OOP).

## 1. Function Style
Some personal tips about how to make a nice function:
- Name your function as if it's a command you are giving to the class and make the class 'do things'. Same as _pop_ is saying 'Hey list, pop this off.' It isn't called _remove\_from\_end\_of\_list_ because even though that's what it does. that's not a command to a list.  
- Keep your function small and simple.  

## 2. Class Style
- Use 'camel case' like MyClassName rather than my_class_name.  
- Try not to do too much in the \_\_init\_\_ functions. It makes them harder to use.  
- Be consistent in how you organize your funciton arguments.  
- Try not to use variables come from the module or globals. They should be fairly self-contained.  
- A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. Consistency is good, but foolish following some idiotic mantra. Think for yourself.  
- Always have _class Name(object)_ format or else you will get in big trouble.  

## 3. Code Style
- Give your code vertical space so people can read it, 'cause the human eye and brain use space and vertical alignment to scan and seperate visual elements. No having space is the same as giving your code an awesome camouflage paint job.  
- If you cann't read it out loud, it's probably hard to read. If you are having a problem making something easy to use, try reading it out loud. Not only does this force you to slow down and really read it also helps u find difficult passages and things to change for readability.  
- Try to do what other people are doing until you find your own style. Once you find it, do not be a jerk about it.  
- If you find someone who writes code in a style you like, trying writing something that mimics that style.  

## 4. Good Comments
- Some programmers will tell u that your code should be readable enough that you do not need comments. Ignore them and write comments.  
- When you write comments, describe why you are doing what you are doing. The code already says how, but why you did things the way you did is more important.  
- When you write doc comments for your functions, make the comments documentation for someone who will have to use your code.  
- While comments are good, too many are bad, and you have to maintain them. Keep your comments relatively short and to the point.
