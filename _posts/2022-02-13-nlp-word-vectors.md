  “<strong>There is in all things a pattern that is part of our universe. It has symmetry, elegance, and grace</strong> - those qualities you find always in that which the true artist captures. You can find it in the turning of the seasons, in the way sand trails along a ridge, in the branch clusters of the creosote
  bush or the pattern of its leaves. <br /><br />
