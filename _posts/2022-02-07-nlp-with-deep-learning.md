Some suggestions to start learning to feed yourself and evaluate your solutions rather than just copy solutions out of textbooks. 

## 1. Function Style
Some personal tips about how to make a nice function:
- Name your function as if it's a command you are giving to the class and make the class 'do things'. Same as _pop_ is saying 'Hey list, pop this off.' It isn't called _remove\_from\_end\_of\_list_ because even though that's what it does. that's not a command to a list.  
- Keep your function small and simple.
